## Selected Design: Professional Minimalism with Strategic Blue Accents (Concept 1)

I have chosen **Concept 1** for the following reasons:

1. **Brand Alignment**: The deep blue (#003D82) directly reflects iXL's existing brand identity visible in the portfolio and current website, ensuring consistency.

2. **Professional Authority**: The minimalist approach with strategic accents positions iXL as a mature, trustworthy consulting firm while the teal accents signal innovation and forward-thinking.

3. **Content Focus**: The generous whitespace and clean layout ensure that the rich content from the portfolio (750K+ developers trained, 17 countries, multiple accelerator programs) is presented clearly and compellingly.

4. **Accessibility & Readability**: The light background with dark text ensures excellent readability for all users, particularly important for a B2B consulting website where clarity is paramount.

5. **Modern Yet Timeless**: This approach avoids trendy dark modes or overly experimental layouts, ensuring the website remains relevant and professional for years to come.

6. **Visual Hierarchy**: The asymmetric layouts and diagonal dividers create visual interest without sacrificing the professional aesthetic that clients expect from a consulting firm.

**Design Implementation Details**:
- Primary Color: Deep Professional Blue (#003D82)
- Secondary Color: Light Slate Gray (#F5F7FA)
- Accent Color: Vibrant Teal (#00A8CC)
- Typography: Poppins (headings) + Inter (body)
